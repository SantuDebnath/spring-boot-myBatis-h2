# Technical Stack description

**Spring Boot** : Spring Boot is a brand new framework from the team at Pivotal, designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of a new Spring application. The framework takes an opinionated approach to configuration, freeing developers from the need to define boilerplate configuration

**MyBatis**: MyBatis is a Java persistence framework that couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using an XML descriptor or annotations.
MyBatis is light weight and fast compared to Hibernate/JPA. Here you dont need to learn HQL or JPQL. You can do anything with mysql.

**H2** : H2 is a relational database management system written in Java. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode

**HATEOAS** : The Hypermedia Constraint (formerly known as HATEOAS) is a constraint that is used to provide direction to the user-agent.

By including links in returned representations, the server can remove the burden from the user-agent of determining what actions can be taken based on the current application state and knowing who to interact with in-order to achieve that goal.
